# TDEngine

## About

TDEngine is a small CLI 3D engine for the terminal in Rust.

TDEngine is able to load .obj files (not ones with too many triangles), and you can turn and zoom around the object.

## How to use

`tdengine (obj_file_path)`

If no file path provided, will just load a square.

## How to compile

Just a `cargo build --release` is enough.
